üêû Bug Report ‚Äì 502 Bad Gateway Error on ISBN Request in Postman

ID: BUG-004
Title: GET /Book?ISBN={isbn} returns 502 Bad Gateway in Postman but 200 OK in Insomnia
Date: 2025-06-19
Reporter: Maca Dana

Description
When sending a request to the API endpoint with a specific ISBN using Postman, the server responds with a 502 Bad Gateway error. The same request with the same ISBN sent from Insomnia returns a successful 200 OK response.

Steps to Reproduce
Open Postman and create a GET /Book?ISBN={{isbn}} request.
Set the variable isbn with a valid value (e.g., 9781234567890).
Send the request and observe the 502 Bad Gateway response.
Open Insomnia and send the same request with the same ISBN.
Observe that the response is 200 OK.
Expected Result
A 200 OK response with the book details for the specified ISBN, regardless of the API client used.

Actual Result
Postman sends an incorrectly formatted URL (e.g., isbn=9781234567890=null), causing the server to return a 502 Bad Gateway error.

Investigation
It was found that in Postman, the isbn variable is either not set correctly or is concatenated incorrectly in the URL.
In Insomnia, the parameter is sent correctly without the extra =null value.
The issue may be caused by an uninitialized or empty variable or incorrect URL construction in Postman.
Suggested Fix
Correct the way the isbn variable is set in Postman.
Validate variables before sending the request.
Add error handling in the Pre-request Script to prevent sending requests with unset or invalid variables.
