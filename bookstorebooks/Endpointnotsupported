Title:
PUT request to /BookStore/v1/Books endpoint returns "Cannot PUT" error

Description:
When attempting to update a book in the userâ€™s Book Store collection via PUT request to https://demoqa.com/BookStore/v1/Books, the server responds with an error page stating Cannot PUT /BookStore/v1/Books. This indicates that the PUT method is not supported or the endpoint is not implemented for this operation.

Steps to Reproduce:

Create a user with POST /Account/v1/User.
Generate a token with POST /Account/v1/GenerateToken.
Add a book with POST /BookStore/v1/Books.
Attempt to update the book by sending a PUT request to /BookStore/v1/Books with proper headers and payload.
Actual Result:

Response status: 404 or an error page with message Cannot PUT /BookStore/v1/Books.
The book cannot be updated using PUT.
Expected Result:

The API should support updating book information via PUT or return a meaningful error message if not supported.
Alternatively, documentation should clarify the correct method for updating books.
Additional Notes:

UserId validation errors were also observed during the PUT attempts, indicating potential issues with payload structure or authorization.
The POST method is supported for adding books, but update functionality appears missing or undocumented.
