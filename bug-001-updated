 Steps to Reproduce (Updated):

Open Safari browser (version tested: Safari 
Go to: https://demoqa.com/register
Complete all required fields
Enter a valid password that includes:
1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, 1 digit, 1 special character, and at least 8 characters total
Example: Test@1234
Click Register
ðŸ¤• Actual Result:

Error is shown in Safari only:

"Passwords must have at least one non alphanumeric character, one digit ('0'-'9'), one uppercase ('A'-'Z'), one lowercase ('a'-'z'), one special character and Password must be eight characters or longer."
âœ… In Chrome (and potentially other browsers), the same password works and account is created successfully.

ðŸ§© Additional Notes:

Likely caused by browser-specific JavaScript validation logic
Could be due to differences in how Safari interprets regex, HTML5 validation, or how the form is submitted
Needs testing in Firefox/Edge for confirmation
******* AFTER USER REGISTER ON CHROME THE USER CAN LOGIN WITH THE CREDENTIALS ON SAFARI- so the problem seems to be only on registration on Safari
