# ❌ Bug Report: Profile section does not load or behave consistently across browsers

**ID:** BUG-UI-003  
**Module:** User Profile / BookStore UI  
**Severity:** Major  
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Open  
**Date Reported:** 2025-06-18  
**Environment:**
- ✅ Safari (Profile page partially loads)
- ❌ Chrome (Profile page appears blank)

---

## 🔥 Description:
The "Profile" section of the DemoQA BookStore behaves differently depending on the browser.  
In Chrome, the page is blank. In Safari, the profile page loads a table with search input, but no books are shown unless the backend interaction succeeds.

---

## 🧪 Steps to Reproduce:

### 🔹 On Chrome:
1. Login to DemoQA
2. Click on "Profile"
3. Observe: Blank page, no content rendered

### 🔹 On Safari:
1. Login to DemoQA
2. Click on "Profile"
3. Observe:
   - A table is visible with a search input
   - Presumably shows added books, but likely empty if none added

---

## 😵 Actual Result:
- Chrome: Entire Profile page blank
- Safari: Table structure shows, but unclear if data populates correctly

## ✅ Expected Result (Both browsers):
- Profile page should render correctly
- Show table with:
  - User’s added books
  - Search field
  - Action buttons (Delete, Log Out)

---

## 🔍 Technical Clues:
- Missing or broken frontend logic likely tied to async API responses (e.g., book list not loaded)
- Chrome may fail silently on rendering due to JavaScript or CORS-related issue
- Safari partially renders due to different JS/CSS handling

---

## 💡 Recommendation:
- Debug console logs in both browsers
- Ensure error handling is consistent in case of missing data
- Normalize rendering of UI components across browsers
