**Module:** Book Store – Book Details View  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Status:** Open  
**Date Reported:** 2025-06-18  
**Environment:**  
- OS: Windows/macOS  
- Browsers: Chrome, Safari  
- URL: `https://demoqa.com/books?book=9781449325862`

## 🔥 Description:
When a user clicks on a book title from the book list, they are redirected to a book detail page. However, the detail page is blank – no information is rendered.

---

## 🧪 Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the Book Store page: https://demoqa.com/books
2. Click on any book (e.g., “Git Pocket Guide”)
3. The app navigates to a page like `...?book=9781449325862`
4. Observe that the page content is empty

---

## 😵 Actual Result:
- Page loads with no visible book information
- Possibly due to JavaScript or API handling error

## ✅ Expected Result:
- Page should display:
  - Title
  - Author
  - Description
  - ISBN, Pages, Publisher, etc.

---

## 🔍 Technical Clue:
- API `GET /Book?ISBN=9781449325862` tested separately and returns valid JSON
- Browser console may show `TypeError` or fetch error in JavaScript

---

## 💡 Recommendation:
Frontend should correctly parse `book` from URL and call `GET /Book?ISBN=...`, then render the response.
