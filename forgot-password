## 1. ‚ùå Missing "Forgot Password" Functionality

- **Area:** Login Form
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Type:** Usability / Functional
- **Steps to Reproduce:**
  1. Navigate to the login page
  2. Enter a wrong username and password
  3. Observe the error message: "Invalid username or password"
  4. No option to recover or reset password is displayed

- **Expected Behavior:**  
  A visible "Forgot password?" link should be available. If email is not part of the form, recovery is impossible, which locks out the user.

- **Recommendation:**  
  Either request an email at login or provide a separate password recovery path.
